# Starbucks-clustering-using-KMeans-and-DBScan
Starbucks clustering using KMeans and DBScan to identify current trends and best future strategies for the company using clustering.

The notebook contains a detailed exploration of the starbucks dataset available on kaggle. The data exploration and visualisation has been done in various stages. The notebook itself is very detailed and should be enough for any inference required. An anaconda environment was used for the development of this project. The requirements along with the code to load a new exact environment are present in the environments.txt file. The data in it's JSON format has also been pushed here. Please refer the notebook for more details.
